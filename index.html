<h1>Week 2</h1>

<h2>Question 1</h2> .
<h3> What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</h3>
<p>The first thing that caught my eye was when moving around the curser the background would change colours, however depending on which direction you have </p>
 <p>  Certain keys words in the designers introduction paragraph would change. I thought this to be a creative way to show their web design.</p>

        <div>
        <h2>Question 3</h2>
        <h3>What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</h3>
        <p>The picture on the last page, which shows a mountain made of pixels was pretty interesting as once the mouse hovers over the image it was enlarge and the pixels start to
            spread out. I found I spent the most time playing around with that.
        </p>
    
    </div>

        
            
            <div>
            <h2>Question 4</h2>
            <h3> What was the most common action in your two-minute interaction with the experience? </h3>
            <p>The most common action when interacting with this experience was scrolling down through the pages, each page was a different visual experience.</p>
        </div>

           
                
                <div>
                <h2>Question 5</h2>
                <h3>What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience? </h3>
               <p>My impression of the primary goal was that the web designer, Palat Tuntaopas to present a portfolio by showcasing their skills. </p>




                
                    
                    <div>
                    <h2>Question 6</h2>
                    <h3>How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?</h3>
                    <p>The interactive experience communicates the designers main goal, by showcasing many CSS techniques.</p>
                    <p>The website showcases great examples of CSS styling, from different fonts and colour selection. </p>
                    <p>They've also showed the use of JavaScript animations as seen when scrolling down the page but additionally on the last page of the website,</p>
                     <p>when hovering how the text a fun animation will appear.</p>
                </div>



                    
                        
                    <div>
                        <h2>Question 7</h2>
                        <h3>What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times) </h3>
                        <p> My impression is this website is made for short term use. You click on the website and explore what the designer is trying to communicate in them.
                            portfolio. </p>
                            <p> I believe it was designed for potential clients to see what this designer can offer in terms of their website design. </p>
                        
                    
                    
                    </div>                        

                        
<div>
<h2>Question 8</h2>
 <h3>How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over time? </h3>
<p>I find this website is straight to the point. Once the user has scrolled through the pages and seen the examples of CSS styling and different animations, </p> 
    <p>from there will click on the buttons which will lead users either to the designers LinkedIn or contact page. Therefore, I believe this website was intended for short term use.

    <h1>Week 3</h1>

    <div>
        <h2>Question 9</h2>
        <h3> What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference? </h3>
        
         <p> I'd say this experience references a few different styles. </p>
          <p>Like other portfolios made by designers. </p>
                  </p>
        </div>
        
        
            
            <div>
            <h2>Question 10</h2>
            <h3>What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act when engaging with your research experience? </h3>
           <p> I'd say the references communicate very similar to many technologies’ companies for example apple, when scrolling down the apple website
            there is usually moving imagery and animation to go with it, </p>
        </div>
        
            
                
                <div>
                <h2>Question 11</h2>
                <h3>What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel when engaging with your research experience? </h3>
                <p> to entice the user to look around. Also, the bright colours and different interactions helps users.
                    to be curious and scroll to the end of the page. The website has a lot of playful interactions and animations which leads the user to the designer’s links.
                </p>
            
            </div>
        
        
                
                    
                    <div>
                    <h2>Question 12</h2>
                    <h3> What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes that part frustrating? </h3>
                    <p> The most frustrating part of the interaction is when changing the window size to the smallest size, everything was responsive expect for the pixel displacement image.
                        It disappears as the page gets smaller.
                    </p>
                </div>
        
        
                   
                        
                        <div>
                        <h2>Question 13</h2>
                        <h3> What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes that part satisfying? </h3>
                       <P> The most satisfying part of this interaction I’d say would be the interactive backgrounds you can play with, 
                        as said in question 1 the homepage with the background that changes colour depending on which direction you move the cursor.
                       </P>
